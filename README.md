 As JavaScript programs grow in size and complexity, it makes sense to split content into separate files for organization. Nobody wants to deal with a single JavaScript file with 10,000 lines of code. Code that is split into files that contain specific sets of functionality are called "modules."

Modern implementations provide us with two keywords to enable this functionality: import and export.
